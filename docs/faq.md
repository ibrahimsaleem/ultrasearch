- **Graph-based Selective Recomputation**: Core innovation for efficiency
- **RAG-Optimized**: Designed specifically for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- **Privacy-First**: Local processing with no data leakage

### What does LEANN stand for?
LEANN stands for "Low-Storage Vector Index" - emphasizing its core innovation of dramatically reduced storage requirements.

## üîß Technical Questions

### What embedding models are supported?
LEANN supports multiple embedding models:
- **Sentence Transformers**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, `all-mpnet-base-v2`
- **OpenAI**: `text-embedding-ada-002`, `text-embedding-3-small`
- **Ollama**: `mxbai-embed-large`, `nomic-embed-text`
- **Custom**: Any compatible embedding model

### What backends are available?
- **HNSW**: Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs (default)
- **DiskANN**: Large-scale disk-based indexing
- **Custom**: Pluggable architecture for new backends

### How does the 97% storage reduction work?
LEANN uses graph-based selective recomputation:

2. **Efficient Storage**: Store only necessary vectors
3. **Dynamic Updates**: Add new data without full recomputation
4. **Optimized Retrieval**: Fast similarity search with minimal storage

### What is AST-aware chunking?
AST-aware chunking preserves code structure and semantics:
- **Code Structure**: Maintains function and class boundaries
- **Semantic Preservation**: Keeps related code together
- **Language Support**: Python, JavaScript, Java, and more
- **Better Search**: More accurate code search results
